1) Create a named tuple Employee with properties name, employee_id, position, salary

2) Implement a stack using the deque collection

3) You are tasked with creating a configuration management program using Python's ChainMap.
 Your program should allow you to manage configuration settings from multiple sources
  (e.g., defaults, user-specific)
   and retrieve values from these sources.

   user settings should always override the default settings

   ```default_settings = {
        "theme": "light",
        "font_size": 12,
        "language": "English"
      }

      user_settings = {
        "theme": "dark",
        "font_size": 18,
        "language": "English"
      }
  ```
  current_settings = ChainMap(...)
