Create a Python program that uses polymorphism to calculate shipping costs for different types of packages.
 Define a base abstract class Package with a method calculate_shipping_cost()
 and create different subclasses for various package types.


 Package

 RegularPackage
 LargePackage
 International package

 shipping cost = 5 + 0.5*weight
                = 20 + 0.5 * weight
                = 100 + 0.8 * weight

    @abstractmethod
    calcuate_shipping(package)
    {

    }
