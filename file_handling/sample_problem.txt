**Problem: Student Grade Tracker**

You are tasked with creating a Python program that can read, update, and display student grades using file handling. You need to implement the following functionalities:

1. **Reading Student Grades**:
   - Create a file named "student_grades.txt" that contains the following data:
     ```
     Alice 95
     Bob 88
     Carol 72
     David 91
     ```

2. **Displaying Student Grades**:
   - Write a function `display_grades(filename)` that reads the content of the file and displays the student names and their corresponding grades.

3. **Updating Student Grades**:
   - Write a function `update_grade(filename, student_name, new_grade)` that takes the filename, a student's name, and their new grade as input.
   - Update the grade of the specified student in the file.
   - Display a message indicating whether the update was successful.

4. **Adding New Student Grades**:
   - Write a function `add_student(filename, student_name, grade)` that takes the filename, a new student's name, and their grade as input.
   - Add the new student's name and grade to the file.
   - Display a message indicating whether the addition was successful.
